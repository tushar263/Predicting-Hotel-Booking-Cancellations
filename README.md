**Predicting Hotel Cancellations**
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict hotel cancellations once a booking is made. The goal is to help booking platforms like MakeMyTrip and Agoda identify which bookings are likely to be canceled, allowing them to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.

**Introduction**
Hotel cancellations significantly impact hotel revenue management and customer satisfaction. This project focuses on predicting whether a booking will be canceled using historical data. Accurate predictions can help hotels manage inventory better and improve the overall customer experience.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Hotel Booking Demand Dataset from Kaggle. It contains booking information from a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details such as:

Booking dates
Length of stay
Number of adults, children, and babies
Meal plan
Country of origin
Customer type
Reserved room type and assigned room type
Deposit type and special requests

**Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values (e.g., dropping missing values in the children column due to their very small number)
Grouping less frequent categories in categorical columns like country and agent
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling for numerical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the distribution and relationships of variables in the dataset. Key insights included:

**Booking Trends:** Analyzed seasonal booking patterns and how they impact cancellation rates.
**Cancellation Patterns:** Explored factors that might influence cancellations, such as lead time, special requests, and customer type.
**Customer Demographics:** Investigated how customer demographics and booking details relate to cancellations.

**Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering involved creating new variables that might better capture the nuances of hotel bookings, such as:

Peak Season indicator based on the arrival date
Binning of previous_bookings_not_canceled using pd.cut to categorize the data
Model Building
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
XGBoost
The models were evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC.

**Results**
The best-performing model was [mention the best model here] with an accuracy of [mention accuracy], indicating its effectiveness in predicting cancellations.

**Conclusion**
The developed model can significantly assist hotels and booking platforms in predicting cancellations, allowing for better resource management and improved customer satisfaction.
